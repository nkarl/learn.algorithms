This document catalogues all patterns that I have learned so far. This also works as a quick look up table for future references.

- **Monotonic Stack**
	- [[note|the 132 pattern]]
- **Graphs** (advanced recurrence)
	- not including trees
- **Recurrence**
	- **Divide-N-Conquer**
		- [[divide-conquer|Longest Common Prefix]]
	- **Binary Search**
		- [[binary-search|Longest Common Prefix]]
	- **DFS**
		- [[dfs-strategy|DFS strategy for tree]]
	- BFS
	- **Dynamic Programming**
		- optimize for space-time complexity using cache
- **Two-Pointers|Two Pointers**
	1. *same direction*
		- **Sliding Window**
			- to evaluate sub-arrays/sub-strings with *contiguous/consecutive elements*
			- to find max sum window
	1. opposite directions
		- 
	2. Tortoise and Hare (at *different speeds*)
		- use case: *to check for cycles* in a linked list
