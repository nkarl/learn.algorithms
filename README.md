### New

- **Sliding Window**
	- to evaluate <u>contiguous</u> sub-array/sub-string
	- to find max sum window
- **Monotonic Stack** (need more practice and use cases)

### Learned

- **Recurrence**
		- to generalize a repeatitive task
	- **Divide-N-Conquer**
		- to solve a problem by breaking it into sub-problems
	- **Binary Search**
		- to find a value in a sorted array in O(logN) time
	- **DFS**
		 - to traverse a tree that is <u>depth</u>-skewed
	- BFS
		- to traverse a tree that is <u>breadth</u>-skewed
	- **Dynamic Programming**
		- optimize for space-time complexity using cache
- **Two Pointers**
	- can move in the same direction
	- can move in opposite directions
	- can move at different speeds (Tortoise and Hare)
		- to check for cycles in a linked list
