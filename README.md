This document catalogues all patterns that I have learned so far. This also works as a quick look up table for future references.

- **[[note|Monotonic Stack]]**
	- need more practice and use cases
- **Advanced Recurrence**
	- [[dfs-strategy|Graphs]]
	- **Regular Recurrence**
		- **Divide-N-Conquer**
			- to solve a problem by breaking it into sub-problems
		- **Binary Search**
			- to find a value in a sorted array in O(logN) time
		- **DFS**
			 - to traverse a tree that is <u>depth</u>-skewed
		- BFS
			- to traverse a tree that is <u>breadth</u>-skewed
		- **Dynamic Programming**
			- optimize for space-time complexity using cache
- **[[Two-Pointers|Two Pointers]]**
	1. *same direction*
		- **Sliding Window**
			- to evaluate <u>contiguous</u> sub-array/sub-string
			- to find max sum window
	1. opposite directions
		- 
	2. Tortoise and Hare (at *different speeds*)
		- use case: *to check for cycles* in a linked list
